###### Prerequisites 
   - Docker

###### What principles did you apply? 
  - Continues build 
  - Automated provisioning 
  - Containerization

###### Explain the decisions you made and why you thought it was the best approach.

I Decided to deploying web applications with Docker since the deployment is much faster, the management is minimal.

###### If you ran out of time, how did you envision your finished infrastructure?

If I had more time first thing was to explore ansible docker modules for dynamic arguments in playbook and consider the addition of WSGI HTTP Server.

My recommendation is to add container orchestaration system needed such as Kubernetes, in order for better provisioning.
